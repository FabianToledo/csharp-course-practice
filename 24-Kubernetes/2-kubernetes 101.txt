# Kubernetes 101

## [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)
Typically one, sometimes multiple containers (tightly coupled)

## [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
Each services gets its own stable IP address, DNS name, and port
Uses labels to dynamically associate with Pods

## [ReplicaSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/)
Number of replicas for a Pod
Desired State and Current State

## [Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
1. Replication controller
2. Rolling updates: when updating a pod, k8s take down one replica and spin up a new pod with the update
   then does the same with a second replica and the rest one by one (or by groups)

## Other Workload (not covered in detail here)
* [CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/)
* [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) (run copy of a pod on every)
* [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/)
* [StatefulSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/) (like deployments, but optimized for stateful)

## [Labels & Selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors)
* Key/value pairs for K8s objects
* Organize and select objects
* Used to define relationships of objects
  E.g. service -> pod
