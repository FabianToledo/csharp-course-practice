### Kube Intro

#### Helm

Is a package manager for kubernetes. It works using Charts (scripts) to define, install and upgrade a Kubernetes application.
* A Chart is a Helm package. It contains the all the definitions to run an application inside of a Kubernetes cluster.
* A Repository is the place where Charts can be collected and shared.
* A Release is an instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. One Chart can be installed many time into the same cluster. Each time a new release is created.

**In summary**:  
Helm installs charts into Kubernetes, creating a new release for each installation. And to find new charts, you can search Helm chart repositories.
