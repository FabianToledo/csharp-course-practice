Actors
------

* Resource Owner: the user
* Client: the client app (desktop, mobile, web, etc.)
* Protected resource: the API
* Authorization server: e.g. Azure active directory (AD)

Steps
----- 

1. The Resource Owner wants to use the Client (e.g. an Angular app). The Client App needs to access the Protected Resource with the identity of the Resource Owner.

2. The Resource Owner login to the Authorization Server. The Resource Owner never types its password directly in the Client App,
instead the Client App redirects or shows a popup with the login coming from the Authorization Server.

3. The Resource Owner enters its credentials (password and username, fingerprint, faceID, etc.) in the Authorization Server login.

4. The Authorization Server creates a Token thet contains information about who is the Resource Owner, Claims (first name, last name, e-mail, etc.).
The Token is digitally signed by the Authorization Server. Also, the token is generated for a specific audience, i.e., only for a specific Protected Resource.

5. The Token is redirected to the Client App and it can be used to access the Protected Resource (API).

6. When the Protected Resource receives the Token it can check if:  

    a. the token is for the Client App,  
    b. the Resource Owner is who he claims to be?  
    c. the token is for this Protected Resource (audience)?  
 
7. If all these are true, then the Client App can access the Protected Resource.


Azure AD
--------

1. Go to **portal.azure.com** and login.

2. Go to **Azure Active Directory**.

3. On the left menu go to **App Registrations**

4. Registry the **Client App**  
	a. Click on **New Registration**
	b. Put the user-facing name for the application.
	c. Give access, here we can choose the accounts which can access the application:
	   * Only the organizational directory (the same organization in azure)
	   * Any organizational directory (any organization in azure)
	   * Any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts (Skype, Xbox, etc.)
	   * Personal Microsoft accounts only.
	d. Click on Create. Once created, we obtain 2 important IDs:
	   * Application (client) ID: a0c1cfbc-a29b-4624-9d7a-eab510dae0e1 (identifies the client)
	   * Directory (tenant) ID: e08fae28-e699-412e-b772-ca4ef45068a7 (identifies the authentication server)
	
5. We need to specify, how users are going to authenticate: click on the Manage --> Authentication menu.
   * Specify a platform on which we will build our client app (Web, Single page application or SPA (react, angular, etc.), iOS/macOS, Android, Windows mobile and desktop, etc.). + Add platform
   * We are going to implement an Angular App, so we chose a SPA
   * We have to specify a redirect URI (the URI accepted as destination when returning tokens after successfully authenticating.
   * Click on Configure. The flow is: Authorization Code Flow with PKCE.

6. Registry the **Protected Resource**
	* API permissions:    
	   By default, there is already an authorized API: Microsoft Graph -> **User.Read** it can be used to Sign in and read the user profile. (https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me)
	   The API permissions could be:  
	   * Delegated permissions: where the app connects to the API on behalf of a user.  
	   * Applications permissions: where an app is authorized to access an endpoint (e.g. a background app sending emails)  

Angular App
-----------

Install or update the necessary packages:  
npm install -g @angular/cli

Create a basic Angular app without tests:  
ng new azure-auth --minimal --skip-git --style css --strict --directory azure-auth --routing false

cd azure-auth

Install the dependencies
------------------------

npm install @azure/msal-angular

npm install @azure/msal-browser

npm install @microsoft/microsoft-graph-types --save-dev

npm start

Register custom API on Azure AD
-------------------------------

1. Create a **New APP Registration** in AAD following steps 1 through 4

2. Expose an API  
    a. Set an application ID URI (The globally unique URI used to identify the web API)  
	Click on **set**  
	By default the uri is set a GUID but can be any type of unique URI.  
    b. Scopes defined by this API:
	in this area we can define the permissions (scopes) to this API
	In this example we are going to create 2 scopes:
		i. read
		Who can consent?: admin and users
		In Both consents put:
		Display name: Read data
		Description: Allows the app to read data on the user's behalf
		i. write
		Who can consent?: admin and users
		In Both consents put:
		Display name: Write data
		Description: Allows the app to write data on the user's behalf
		
Create an ASP.net API
--------------------

1. Install the nuget package: **Microsoft.Identity.Web**

2. On Program.cs:  
##### Add to the services container:  
```
builder.Services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(builder.Configuration);
```

Also add authentication and authorization services
This is not part of Azure AD,
if we want auth services we have to add these no matter the Auth server.

```
builder.Services.AddAuthentication();
builder.Services.AddAuthorization();
```

##### Add to the http pipeline the following middleware

Add CORS middleware allowing all for demo purposes.
```
app.UseCors(policy => policy.AllowAnyOrigin().AllowAnyMethod().AllowAnyHeader());
```

Add Authentication middleware
```
app.UseAuthentication();
```

3. Add the AzureAD configuration to *appsettings.json* file:

```
"AzureAd": {
  // Login URL of Microsoft
  "Instance": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/",
  // Client ID of the API App Registration in AAD. 
  // For more information see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app
  "ClientId": "52db4014-9bca-49ee-b0f0-8c033c3ab441",
  // AAD Tenant Id
  "TenantId": "931628cb-1eb4-4122-b9cd-3bf3fc8574d6",
  // The API App's unique URI as specified during app registration.
  // For more details see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis
  "Audience": "api://ae2a7238-27aa-4604-b808-11b514e0b3fd"
}
```

Make our Client App ready to call the protected API
---------------------------------------------------

1. Registry the **Protected Resource** (custom API) in Azure AD
	a. On the already registered **Client App**, go to API permissions:  
    (Azure AD directory --> App Registrations --> **<registered client app>**) --> API permissions  
	b. Add a permission  
	Click on add a permision and select the My APIs tab. This will list applications that expose permissions. Select our registered custom API.
	c. Type of permission: **Delegated permissions**  
	Select read and write permissions.
	d. click on Add permissions
	
2. Add to the Interceptor middleware of the client app, the customAPI mappings:

```
protectedResourceMap.set(environment.customApi, [
  'api://ae2a7238-27aa-4604-b808-11b514e0b3fd/read',
  'api://ae2a7238-27aa-4604-b808-11b514e0b3fd/write'
]);
```

Test our custom protected API using postman
-------------------------------------------

1. On azure AD we need to add a platform to our Client App registration.
	a. Go to App Registration and select the **Client App**  
	b. Go to Authentication and click on **Add a platform**
	c. Select Mobile and desktop applications.
	d. On custom redirect URI write this postman uri: https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback
	
2. Create a new Collection.

3. On the tab Authorization
	a. Select Type: OAuth 2.0
	b. In the section Configure New Token:
		i. Grant Type: Authorization Code (With PKCE) --> This is the type Authorization Code Flow with PKCE, as configured in Azure AD. 
	c. Callback URL: https://oauth.pstmn.io/v1/callback (see postman documentation)	
	d. Auth URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{tenantId}}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
	e. Access Token URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{tenantId}}/oauth2/v2.0/token
	f. The Client ID for the client app.
	g. scope: The permission to the api: e.g. api://48e1fdd4-eb87-4270-b78f-50ba712fb773/read
	h. Click on Get New Access Token
	i. This will cause an authentication page open. Once logged in, a new JWT token will be granted to use.

> Note: the Postman Collection is saved on the file: **./OIDC API test.postman_collection.json**

	
Check for claims in our API
---------------------------

There are 2 classes of constant values that we can use to look for a specific claim  
ClaimTypes (defined in System.Security.Claims): Defines constants for the well-known claim types that can be assigned to a subject.  
```
Console.WriteLine($"User Name: {User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Type == ClaimTypes.Name)?.Value}");
```
ClaimConstants (defined in Microsoft.Identity.Web): Constants for claim types used by microsoft
```
Console.WriteLine($"Object Id: {User.Claims.FirstOrDefault(c => c.Type == ClaimConstants.ObjectId)?.Value}");
```
